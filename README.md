# Animated Bubble Sort JavaScript

I created a simple animation showing how bubble sort works visually.
Bubble sort is by far not the most efficient sorting method, but for the purposes of this learning exercise, it was simple enough to be made into an animation.

## What I learned
- I learned how to make animations using JavaScript
- Used JavaScript script to embed the animation into an HTML page
